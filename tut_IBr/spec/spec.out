 Number of atoms and number of potentials
 Potential where the initial conditions where created (usually 1) and printlevel (0 minimum, 1 (+energy.out), 2 (+individual.out) or 3 (+dipole*.out)
 Last trajectory employed
 Do you want kinetic energy correction (y/n)?
 Range of energies and number of points for the spectrum (eV)
   0.0000000000000000       0.36749843215538380             1001
